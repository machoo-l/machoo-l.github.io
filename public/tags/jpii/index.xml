      <description>The world is composed of subjects and objects. A subject is an entity that exists and acts in a certain way. An object is an entity to be acted upon. Every subject also exists as on object.
Man is &amp;lsquo;somebody&amp;rsquo; which sets him apart from every other entity which is an object that is &amp;lsquo;something.&amp;rsquo; We would hesitate to call an animal a thing but recognize them as subjects of a particular species.</description>
