      <description>Effeminacy is preferring your pleasure over doing what is difficult. It is effeminate for men to take pleasure in lacking responsibility. Women have no respect for effeminate men who are easily controlled. Too often when men get into a relationship they will give in to the woman&amp;rsquo;s complaining to have some peace and quiet. This weakness shows her that she can push the man around and have her way.
Men must mature by suffering and struggling.</description>

      <description>Modern culture evolves rapidly, adding and removing new terms and conditions you must comply with. There is always a new fad to see and share with your friends. It&amp;rsquo;s dizzying to keep up with it all. Every day is the same endless cycle of scrolling through slightly interesting posts that are, in the end, empty and unfulfilling.
Social media is designed to be an deep void of nothing. Infinite scrolling apps feed you a constant stream of stimulation that leaves you craving for more when you get off your phone.</description>

      <description>Minecraft servers are single threaded so having more CPU cores will not improve the server&amp;rsquo;s performance. Articles recommend 1GB to 2GB of allocated RAM for 10 people on a server.
Client Side (1.20.1) Fabric is mod loader for Minecraft.
(1.20.1) OptiFine is an optimization mod for better performance. Usually you install OptiFine on its own without the Fabric mod loader but since we want voice chat we will need to supplement it with OptiFabric.</description>

      <description>I want to host a permanent Minecraft server for me and my friends to play. Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s tiny business computers seem like a good choice to host the server. It can also be used for a Plex server to stream shows.</description>
