      <title>The Truth of Masculinity; Being Too Afraid To Do Anything Because the Internet and College Makes You Dumb as Hell</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effeminacy&lt;/strong&gt; is
preferring your pleasure over doing what is difficult. It is effeminate for
men to take pleasure in lacking responsibility. Women have no respect for
effeminate men who are easily controlled. Too often when men get into a
relationship they will give in to the woman&amp;rsquo;s complaining to have some
peace and quiet. This weakness shows her that she can push
the man around and have her way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men must &lt;strong&gt;mature&lt;/strong&gt; by suffering and struggling.
Attaining goodness and &lt;strong&gt;virtue&lt;/strong&gt; is difficult. The desire to put
aside your own pleasure to do what is right is the heart of
&lt;strong&gt;masculinity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Social Media, Pop Culture Brain and Self-Reflection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modern culture evolves rapidly, adding and removing new terms and
conditions you must comply with. There is always a new fad to see and
share with your friends. It&amp;rsquo;s dizzying to keep up with it all. Every day
is the same endless cycle of scrolling through slightly interesting posts
that are, in the end, empty and unfulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is designed to
be an deep void of nothing. Infinite scrolling apps feed you a constant
stream of stimulation that leaves you craving for more when you get off
your phone. Millions of creators slave away making content in hopes to
amass a following. They&amp;rsquo;ll do anything for likes and follows such as
posting low quality but somewhat relatable content that you&amp;rsquo;ll share with
your friends. While you consume empty content, big tech is collecting your
data and feeding you precise ads that keep you consuming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Minecraft Server</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minecraft servers are single threaded
so having more CPU cores will not improve the server&amp;rsquo;s performance.
Articles recommend 1GB to 2GB of allocated RAM for 10
people on a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;client-side&#34;&gt;Client Side&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1.20.1) &lt;a href=&#34;https://fabricmc.net/&#34;&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt; is mod loader for Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1.20.1) &lt;a href=&#34;https://optifine.net/home&#34;&gt;OptiFine&lt;/a&gt; is an optimization mod for better
performance. Usually you install OptiFine on its own without the Fabric mod loader
but since we want voice chat we will need to supplement it with OptiFabric.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to host a permanent Minecraft server for me and my friends to play.
Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s tiny business computers seem like a good choice to host the server.
It can also be used for a Plex server to stream shows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
