      <description>Effeminacy is preferring your pleasure over doing what is difficult. It is effeminate for men to take pleasure in lacking responsibility. Women have no respect for effeminate men who are easily controlled. Too often when men get into a relationship they will give in to the woman&amp;rsquo;s complaining to have some peace and quiet. This weakness shows her that she can push the man around and have her way.
Men must mature by suffering and struggling.</description>

      <description>Men and women are meant for each other. Men are fulfilled in giving their all to women and women are fulfilled in gifting themselves to men. The differences between men and women make us perfect complements.
Every human person is set apart from all the creatures and objects of the world. Dolphins and monkeys are intelligent animals, but they lack the interior life that comes from personhood. The interior allows a person to choose a goal that he deems to be good.</description>

      <title>The Person as the Subject and Object of Action</title>

      <description>The world is composed of subjects and objects. A subject is an entity that exists and acts in a certain way. An object is an entity to be acted upon. Every subject also exists as on object.
Man is &amp;lsquo;somebody&amp;rsquo; which sets him apart from every other entity which is an object that is &amp;lsquo;something.&amp;rsquo; We would hesitate to call an animal a thing but recognize them as subjects of a particular species.</description>

      <description>Modern culture evolves rapidly, adding and removing new terms and conditions you must comply with. There is always a new fad to see and share with your friends. It&amp;rsquo;s dizzying to keep up with it all. Every day is the same endless cycle of scrolling through slightly interesting posts that are, in the end, empty and unfulfilling.
Social media is designed to be an deep void of nothing. Infinite scrolling apps feed you a constant stream of stimulation that leaves you craving for more when you get off your phone.</description>

      <description>We guard our hearts because we are weak and the world is cruel. You are afraid of being naked and hide your insecurities from others because you fear the pain of judgement. It takes tremendous trust to be vulnerable with someone. You lay bare your heart and all your weakness, trusting that they do not hurt you in your vulnerablility.
It is important to show others love when they are at their lowest.</description>

      <title>Fast Food and Self-Reliance</title>

      <description>Fast food makes you reliant. The convenience of fast food distracts your attention from time spent developing important skills like cooking. Years of consuming fast food makes you reliant on external entities for living.
The Dunkin&amp;rsquo; down your block could close down suddenly one day and you start to panic because you don&amp;rsquo;t know how you&amp;rsquo;ll get through the day without coffee in the morning. If only you invested some time into your future by buying a coffee machine and learning to make your own coffee.</description>
