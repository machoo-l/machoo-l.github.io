      <description>Modern culture evolves rapidly, adding and removing new terms and conditions you must comply with. There is always a new fad to see and share with your friends. It&amp;rsquo;s dizzying to keep up with it all. Every day is the same endless cycle of scrolling through slightly interesting posts that are, in the end, empty and unfulfilling.
Social media is designed to be an deep void of nothing. Infinite scrolling apps feed you a constant stream of stimulation that leaves you craving for more when you get off your phone.</description>

      <description>We guard our hearts because we are weak and the world is cruel. You are afraid of being naked and hide your insecurities from others because you fear the pain of judgement. It takes tremendous trust to be vulnerable with someone. You lay bare your heart and all your weakness, trusting that they do not hurt you in your vulnerablility.
It is important to show others love when they are at their lowest.</description>

      <description>Fast food makes you reliant. The convenience of fast food distracts your attention from time spent developing important skills like cooking. Years of consuming fast food makes you reliant on external entities for living.
The Dunkin&amp;rsquo; down your block could close down suddenly one day and you start to panic because you don&amp;rsquo;t know how you&amp;rsquo;ll get through the day without coffee in the morning. If only you invested some time into your future by buying a coffee machine and learning to make your own coffee.</description>
