      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is composed of subjects and objects. A subject is an entity
that exists and acts in a certain way. An object is an entity to be
acted upon. Every subject also exists as on object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man is &amp;lsquo;somebody&amp;rsquo;
which sets him apart from every other entity which is an object that is
&amp;lsquo;something.&amp;rsquo;
We would hesitate to call an animal a thing but recognize
them as subjects of a particular species. It isn&amp;rsquo;t fitting to define
man as an individual homo sapien, rather he is a &amp;lsquo;person.&amp;rsquo; Their is a
richness and perfection in the manner of his being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
