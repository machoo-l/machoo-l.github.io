      <description>The world is composed of subjects and objects. A subject is an entity that exists and acts in a certain way. An object is an entity to be acted upon. Every subject also exists as on object.
Man is &amp;lsquo;somebody&amp;rsquo; which sets him apart from every other entity which is an object that is &amp;lsquo;something.&amp;rsquo; We would hesitate to call an animal a thing but recognize them as subjects of a particular species.</description>

      <description>Lord Jesus Christ, take all my freedom, my understanding, and my will. All that I have and cherish you have given to me. I surrender it all to be guided by your will. Your love and your grace are wealth enough for me. Give me these, Lord Jesus, and I ask for nothing more. Amen.</description>

      <description>I want to host a permanent Minecraft server for me and my friends to play. Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s tiny business computers seem like a good choice to host the server. It can also be used for a Plex server to stream shows.</description>
