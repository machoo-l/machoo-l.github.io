      <description>We guard our hearts because we are weak and the world is cruel. You are afraid of being naked and hide your insecurities from others because you fear judgement. It takes tremendous trust to be vulnerable with someone. You lay bare your heart and all your weakness, trusting that they do not hurt you in your vulnerablility.
It is important to show others love when they are at their lowest. Be the warm consolation that gives them security.</description>

      <description>Lord Jesus Christ, take all my freedom, my understanding, and my will. All that I have and cherish you have given to me. I surrender it all to be guided by your will. Your love and your grace are wealth enough for me. Give me these, Lord Jesus, and I ask for nothing more. Amen.</description>
