      <description>The world is composed of subjects and objects. A subject is an entity that exists and acts in a certain way. An object is an entity to be acted upon. Every subject also exists as on object.
Man is &amp;lsquo;somebody&amp;rsquo; which sets him apart from every other entity which is an object that is &amp;lsquo;something.&amp;rsquo; We would hesitate to call an animal a thing but recognize them as subjects of a particular species.</description>

      <description>We guard our hearts because we are weak and the world is cruel. You are afraid of being naked and hide your insecurities from others because you fear the pain of judgement. It takes tremendous trust to be vulnerable with someone. You lay bare your heart and all your weakness, trusting that they do not hurt you in your vulnerablility.
It is important to show others love when they are at their lowest.</description>

      <description>Lord Jesus Christ, take all my freedom, my understanding, and my will. All that I have and cherish you have given to me. I surrender it all to be guided by your will. Your love and your grace are wealth enough for me. Give me these, Lord Jesus, and I ask for nothing more. Amen.</description>

      <description>I want to host a permanent Minecraft server for me and my friends to play. Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s tiny business computers seem like a good choice to host the server. It can also be used for a Plex server to stream shows.</description>
