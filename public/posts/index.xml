      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/792422496966728117/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Polo Ralph Lauren Denim Vest Fall 2023 Look\nBook&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/polo_ralph_lauren_denim_v_neck_vest.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;polo-ralph-lauren-denim-vest&#34;&gt;Polo Ralph Lauren Denim Vest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vest is from Polo&amp;rsquo;s Fall 2023 ready-to-wear look book. Well fitted
vests accentuate the slimness of the waist and creates the appearance
of broader shoulders. The dark wash of the denim offers a polished
and semi-formal look. The wide fitting pants contrasts the fitted vest,
creating a proportional small top-big bottom silhoutte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing the garment requires darts at the waist to reduce fabric
in the area and tailor the fit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Truth of Masculinity; Being Too Afraid To Do Anything Because the Internet and College Makes You Dumb as Hell</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effeminacy&lt;/strong&gt; is
preferring your pleasure over doing what is difficult. It is effeminate for
men to take pleasure in lacking responsibility. Women have no respect for
effeminate men who are easily controlled. Too often when men get into a
relationship they will give in to the woman&amp;rsquo;s complaining to have some
peace and quiet. This weakness shows her that she can push
the man around and have her way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men must &lt;strong&gt;mature&lt;/strong&gt; by suffering and struggling.
Attaining goodness and &lt;strong&gt;virtue&lt;/strong&gt; is difficult. The desire to put
aside your own pleasure to do what is right is the heart of
&lt;strong&gt;masculinity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Together Man and Woman</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/13-the-role-of-men-and-women/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Men and women are meant for each other. Men are fulfilled in giving their all
to women and women are fulfilled in gifting themselves to men.
The differences between men and women make us perfect complements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every human person is set apart from all the creatures and objects of the world.
Dolphins and monkeys are intelligent animals, but they lack the interior
life that comes from personhood. The interior allows a person to choose a goal
that he deems to be good.
There is a natural order to all things which arranges all good things in
a hierarchy. Ideally, we order the person (soul) over the body.
Thus, each person&amp;rsquo;s dignity ought to be upheld and respected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Person as the Subject and Object of Action</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/11-cbc-love-and-responsibility-1/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/11-cbc-love-and-responsibility-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is composed of subjects and objects. A subject is an entity
that exists and acts in a certain way. An object is an entity to be
acted upon. Every subject also exists as on object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man is &amp;lsquo;somebody&amp;rsquo;
which sets him apart from every other entity which is an object that is
&amp;lsquo;something.&amp;rsquo;
We would hesitate to call an animal a thing but recognize
them as subjects of a particular species. It isn&amp;rsquo;t fitting to define
man as an individual homo sapien, rather he is a &amp;lsquo;person.&amp;rsquo; Their is a
richness and perfection in the manner of his being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Social Media, Pop Culture Brain and Self-Reflection</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/10-social-media-and-self-reflection/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modern culture evolves rapidly, adding and removing new terms and
conditions you must comply with. There is always a new fad to see and
share with your friends. It&amp;rsquo;s dizzying to keep up with it all. Every day
is the same endless cycle of scrolling through slightly interesting posts
that are, in the end, empty and unfulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is designed to
be an deep void of nothing. Infinite scrolling apps feed you a constant
stream of stimulation that leaves you craving for more when you get off
your phone. Millions of creators slave away making content in hopes to
amass a following. They&amp;rsquo;ll do anything for likes and follows such as
posting low quality but somewhat relatable content that you&amp;rsquo;ll share with
your friends. While you consume empty content, big tech is collecting your
data and feeding you precise ads that keep you consuming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vulnerability</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/9-vulnerability/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/9-vulnerability/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We guard our hearts because we are weak and the
world is cruel. You are afraid of being naked
and hide your insecurities from
others because you fear the pain of judgement.
It takes tremendous trust to be vulnerable with someone.
You lay bare your heart and all your weakness, trusting that
they do not hurt you in your vulnerablility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to show
others love when they are at their lowest.
Be the warm consolation that gives them security.
Love your family and friends, even if they do not
openly reveal their vulnerabilities. They are no different from you,
recognize that they also have a lifetime worth
of experiences and hardships.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Minecraft Server</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minecraft servers are single threaded
so having more CPU cores will not improve the server&amp;rsquo;s performance.
Articles recommend 1GB to 2GB of allocated RAM for 10
people on a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;client-side&#34;&gt;Client Side&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1.20.1) &lt;a href=&#34;https://fabricmc.net/&#34;&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt; is mod loader for Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1.20.1) &lt;a href=&#34;https://optifine.net/home&#34;&gt;OptiFine&lt;/a&gt; is an optimization mod for better
performance. Usually you install OptiFine on its own without the Fabric mod loader
but since we want voice chat we will need to supplement it with OptiFabric.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fast Food and Self-Reliance</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/4-fast-food-and-self-reliance/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fast food makes you reliant.
The convenience of fast food distracts your attention from time
spent developing important skills like cooking. Years of consuming fast food
makes you reliant on external entities for living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dunkin&amp;rsquo; down
your block could close down suddenly one day and you start to panic
because you don&amp;rsquo;t know how you&amp;rsquo;ll get through the day without coffee
in the morning. If only you invested some time into your future by
buying a coffee machine and learning to make your own coffee. It&amp;rsquo;s
cheaper in the long run and certainly healthier.
You can fine tune the flavor to your liking instead of being subject
to big coffee&amp;rsquo;s decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lord Jesus Christ, take all my freedom, my understanding, and my will. All that I have and cherish
you have given to me. I surrender it all to be guided by your will. Your love and your grace are
wealth enough for me. Give me these, Lord Jesus, and I ask for nothing more. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to host a permanent Minecraft server for me and my friends to play.
Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s tiny business computers seem like a good choice to host the server.
It can also be used for a Plex server to stream shows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
