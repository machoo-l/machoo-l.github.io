world is cruel. You are afraid of being naked
and hide your insecurities from
others because you fear the pain of judgement.
It takes tremendous trust to be vulnerable with someone.
You lay bare your heart and all your weakness, trusting that
they do not hurt you in your vulnerablility.</p>
<p>It is important to show
others love when they are at their lowest.
Be the warm consolation that gives them security.
Love your family and friends, even if they do not
openly reveal their vulnerabilities. They are no different from you,
recognize that they also have a lifetime worth
of experiences and hardships.</p>
<p>Strive to foster harmonious relationships, display patience, kindness,
humility and heartfelt advice. Cultivate your understanding,
compassion, and vigilance towards others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love
one another, be compassionate and humble&rdquo;
(1 Peter 3:8).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it
does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others,
it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps
no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices
with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes,
always perseveres&rdquo;
(1 Corinthians 13:4-7).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart, and the pleasantness
of a friend springs from their heartfelt advice.&rdquo;
(Proverbs 27:9).</p>
