to women and women are fulfilled in gifting themselves to men.
The differences between men and women make us perfect complements.</p>
<p>Every human person is set apart from all the creatures and objects of the world.
Dolphins and monkeys are intelligent animals, but they lack the interior
life that comes from personhood. The interior allows a person to choose a goal
that he deems to be good.
There is a natural order to all things which arranges all good things in
a hierarchy. Ideally, we order the person (soul) over the body.
Thus, each person&rsquo;s dignity ought to be upheld and respected.</p>
<p>A collection of distinct and free persons can
come together over a common good to create a living community. In particular,
when a man and woman come together in proper love they mutually understand and
harmoniously realize a jointly chosen good. This joyful union comes about when
each member properly orders the dignity of the person over the sexual urge
towards the body.</p>
<p>Naturally, when a man grows in virtue and takes on responsibilities there is the
desire to give up a part of himself to the greater good. With respect to his
community, a man has a duty to protect women, and with respect to his family he
must provide. The mind and body of man are well suited to toil and labor, but he
needs a purpose or a good to aim to. He can devote himself to his community,
friends, or family. However, ultimately, a woman will draw out the most in him.</p>
<p>Women are gifts to be protected and preserved. Society ought to uphold the
dignity of womanhood&ndash;graceful, tender, and humble. The sex positive
attitude denigrates society and causes us to be apathetic to each others&rsquo;
problems.
This movement claims that everyone can resume their lives after having &lsquo;casual&rsquo;
sex with any stranger they just met, all you need is consent!
If this were true then there would be no need for
relationships. However, contrary to modern beliefs, this is not how human
emotions work. There needs to be proper incorporation of the person, the body,
and love in a relationship. Note, that the sexual desire for the body is a good that
brings men and women together, however it can be easily perverted without virtue
to guide it.</p>
<p>Men ought to take responsibility in preserving the dignity of women. So hold
open the door, be an escort when it&rsquo;s late, or throw your body in harms way. Women
have a duty to uphold their dignity aswell because if women didn&rsquo;t
there would be no reason for men to protect it. So, practice modesty,
temperance and prudence. The attention from revealing your body might feel
empowering, but it is at the detriment of your dignity. Men stop sexualizing
women and women stop sexualizing yourselves.</p>
<p>We all want attention. The most fulfilling attention comes from the opposite
sex. It is heartwarming when a person so different from you sees some good
within you and actively desires to foster the good in you. Men and women give
attention in
different ways. Men enjoy doing things for women and women enjoy&hellip; Anyways,
receive a man&rsquo;s service with tender appreciation and he will continue to serve.
Virtuous femininity will draw out the masculinity in a man. Likewise, a virtuous
masculinity will draw out the femininity in a woman. When a man finds his woman
he will lay down his life for her. When a woman finds her man she will gift
herself to him. The love of man for woman and woman for man usually begins as
sexual desire but must develop towards goodwill for each other. In other words,
to love
is to will the good of another. Love is not solely <em>in</em> a man and <em>in</em> a woman but
something common between them. Complete love is the force which joins and
unites. When reciprocal love is fully realized two &lsquo;I&rsquo;s bring into existence a
single &lsquo;we&rsquo;. Reciprocity is the proof that love has matured, that it has become
something &lsquo;between&rsquo; two persons, something shared.</p>
