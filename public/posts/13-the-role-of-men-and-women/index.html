to women and women are fulfilled in gifting themselves to men. There is a
natural order to all things, everything and everyone has a purpose. The
differences between men and women cause us to be perfect complements.</p>
<p>Every human person is set apart from all the creatures and objects of the world.
Dolphins and monkeys are intelligent animals, but they lack the interior
life that comes from personhood. The interior allows a person to choose a goal
that he deems to be good. Because of this each person&rsquo;s dignity should be upheld
and respected.</p>
<p>A collection of distinct and free persons can
come together over a common good to create a living community. In particular,
when a man and woman come together in proper love they mutually understand and
harmoniously realize a jointly chosen good. This joyful union comes about when
each member properly orders the dignity of the person over the sexual urge
towards the body</p>
<p>Naturally, when a man grows in virtue and takes on responsibilities there is the
desire to give up a part of himself to the greater good. With respect to
community, men have a duty to protect women, and with respect to his family he
must provide. The mind and body of man are well suited to toil and labor, but he
needs a purpose or a good to aim to. He can devote himself to his community,
friends, or family. However, ultimately, a woman will draw out the most in him.</p>
<p>Women are gifts to be protected and preserved. Society ought to uphold the
dignity of womanhood which is graceful, tender, and humble. The sex positive
attitude denigrates society and causes us to be apathetic to each others&rsquo;
problems. If everyone could have &lsquo;casual&rsquo; sex with strangers before learning their
names and resume their lives without faltering then there would be no need for
relationships. However, this is not how personhood and love are rightly
incorporated.</p>
<p>Men ought to take responsibility in preserving the dignity of women. So hold open the
door, be an escort when it&rsquo;s late, or throw your body in harms way. Women
have a duty to uphold their dignity aswell because if women didn&rsquo;t
there would be no reason for men to protect it. So, practice modesty,
temperance and prudence. The attention from revealing your body might feel
empowering, but it is at the detriment of your dignity. Men stop sexualizing
women and women stop sexualizing yourselves.</p>
<p>Virtuous femininity will draw out the masculinity in a man. Likewise, a virtuous
masculinity will draw out the femininity in a woman. When a man finds his woman
he will lay down his life for her. When a woman finds her man she will gift
herself to him. The love of man for woman and woman for man usually begins as
desire but must develop towards goodwill for each other. In other words, to love
is to will the good of another. Love is not solely in a man and in a woman but
something common between them. Complete love is the force which joins and
unites.</p>
<p>We all want attention. The most fulfilling attention comes from the opposite
sex. It is heartwarming when a person so different from you sees some good
within you and actively desires for your good. Men and women give attention in
different ways. Men enjoy doing things for women and women enjoy&hellip;</p>
