    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>The world is composed of subjects and objects. A subject is an entity
that exists and acts in a certain way. An object is an entity to be
acted upon. Every subject also exists as on object.</p>
<p>Man is &lsquo;somebody&rsquo;
which sets him apart from every other entity which is an object that is
&lsquo;something.&rsquo;
We would hesitate to call an animal a thing but recognize
them as subjects of a particular species. It isn&rsquo;t fitting to define
man as an individual homo sapien, rather he is a &lsquo;person.&rsquo; Their is a
richness and perfection in the manner of his being.</p>
<p>The simplest reason
for this is that man is a rational being, distinct from the visible
world of objects. Animals are similar to humans in physiology&ndash;skeletal
structure, brain activity, muscle control&ndash;but are vastly different in that
they do not possess an inner life that is characteristic only of persons.
Animals exists to serve their nature. Inner life means spiritual life which
revolves around truth and goodness. It includes many problems, but two seem
central: what is the cause of everthing and how to do what is good.</p>
<p>Because
of man&rsquo;s inner being he is so much involved in the &lsquo;outside&rsquo; world of objects.
Man does merely perceive and respond to the world in a purely mechanical way,
but strives to assert himself, his &lsquo;I,&rsquo; in relation to the world.
Free will is the power to act on choice, which derives from self-determination
and reflection. Each person&rsquo;s will is inalienable and intrinsic to that person&rsquo;s
inner life. <em>No one else can want for me.</em> No one can substitute his act
of will for mine. Sometimes someone wants me to want what they want. This
moment distinguishes me from him&ndash;free will draws the line between
persons. I am, I must be, independent
in my actions. All human relationships are based on this fact.</p>
<p>For a man is not only a subject, but also an object of action. In dealings
of persons of different sexes, the man is an object of action for the woman,
and the woman is an object of action for the man. Sexual morality
and these actions are a constant theme for <em>Love and Responsibility</em> by
Pope John Paul II.</p>
