      <description>We guard our hearts because we are weak and the world is cruel. You are afraid of being naked and hide your insecurities from others because you fear the pain of judgement. It takes tremendous trust to be vulnerable with someone. You lay bare your heart and all your weakness, trusting that they do not hurt you in your vulnerablility.
It is important to show others love when they are at their lowest.</description>
