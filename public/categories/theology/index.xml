      <description>&lt;p&gt;We guard our hearts because we are weak and the
world is cruel. You are afraid of being naked
and hide your insecurities from
others because you fear the pain of judgement.
It takes tremendous trust to be vulnerable with someone.
You lay bare your heart and all your weakness, trusting that
they do not hurt you in your vulnerablility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to show
others love when they are at their lowest.
Be the warm consolation that gives them security.
Love your family and friends, even if they do not
openly reveal their vulnerabilities. They are no different from you,
recognize that they also have a lifetime worth
of experiences and hardships.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
