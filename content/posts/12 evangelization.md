## Does God exist?

My life is relatively easy; I don't have to worry about tomorrow's
meal or if I'll have enough clean clothes for the week. 
For this reason I took most things for granted up until recently.
I don't have to struggle because my parents work hard day in, day out.
And so I've wasted thousands of hours staring at a screen consuming memes, 
watching videos, and playing games. 
Those distractions stole my focus away from what's important--family, 
friends, connection and sharing
life with others. Realizing the beauty of life and the numerous adventures 
that await me invigorates me to take life into my own hands and take responsibility. ## Edit here 

Allow me to layout my observations and thoughts that have lead me towards a brighter life.
I am disappointed in myself because I have nothing to my name, no achievements,
no skills, nothing to show for myself. I've never felt as if I were a real person.
