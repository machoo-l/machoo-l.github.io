**Effeminacy** is
preferring your pleasure over doing what is difficult. It is effeminate for
men to take pleasure in lacking responsibility. Women have no respect for
effeminate men who are easily controlled. Too often when men get into a
relationship they will give in to the woman's complaining to have some
peace and quiet. This weakness shows her that she can push 
the man around and have her way.

Men must **mature** by suffering and struggling. 
Attaining goodness and **virtue** is difficult. The desire to put 
aside your own pleasure to do what is right is the heart of 
**masculinity**.

Go out into the wilderness and create, toil, work. Be
[**magninamous**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnanimity). 
Pursue greatness of soul and master your appetites. 
Turn away from the lower base pleasures
and face the darkness. A man of virtue has interior self discipline and 
mastery of self. He can
stand in the face of evil or pleasure and remain steadfast. He will not 
wilt.

Don't be afraid to stumble, fall, hurt or embarass yourself as you
pursue greatness and virtue. Honor is attained through the act 
striving for the perfection of the virtues. The 
[decadence](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/decadence) of 
our time has lead us to be weak and afraid of doing anything.
We worry too much about making sure everything is perfectly 
planned out. No mistakes can happen. We fear the anxiety
of being wrong and failing. But it's ok, you'll live. Just take 
the leap and adventure into the unknown. 

You don't need a dumbass college degree. School
teaches you to be obedient and uncreative.  
Learning occurs when you ***DO*** things and make mistakes. So
start small projects and start failing. Start sewing some 
clothes, open a textbook and do some problems, write about
literally anything, read some of the classics. Just start
doing.

So stop wasting your waking hours on earth consuming content that numbs 
your senses. Playing games and consuming dumb media drains your thirst 
for adventure and wonder. Be **childlike** and play. The world was 
made for us. The world is your oyster. 

The internet's algorithm is designed to control 
you. Every piece of content
you view is propaganda made to tranquilize your reasoning and keep you from 
having an original thought. Any and all self reflection is snuffed out. 

Every day we read the news to find out what we should believe in and
let other think for us. The 
elites and mainstream media tell us statistics to convince us that 
the economy is good and we should be happy. But when you observe the 
world around you it's obvious that we're not ok. Everytime you open the
instagram comment section you admit to the fact that you 
are not funny and need others to think of funny things for you.

All social media apps are controlled by large corporations and they
are free to push their agenda on every user. With each coming
generation, more of our time is spent looking at screens than 
being outside and interacting with living, breathing, human friends.
It is dangerous to give so much power to a handful of 
[big tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech)
companies. We have collectively given them the power to think
for us. Every meme, post, comment, and like influences our thoughts
and behaviors.

I urge you to break free of the pleasure of scrolling and lacking
responsibility. Start doing what is good 
and difficult. Invite your **homies** to hang and do *silly* things.
