Hi I'm Matthew Le. I appreciate *you* for visiting my
webpage and I hope you learn something new.

I created this website to learn web development and to improve my eloquence in
writing. As our lives grow ever consumed by the internet we neglect the cultivation
of essential personal skills. I desire to spread goodness in the world through
connection and self-giving.

I have plans to add commenting and display other projects that I work on. Thank
you for your interest in my work.
